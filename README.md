# Email-Scraper
This project was inspired from various other repositories and also some of my own ideas that I implemented. It is a simple email extractor which was designed for the idea of information gathering.

# Language
Python

# Working
Once you run the python file, you will be asked to enter the website that you want to scan. Enter the website's complete URL (example: https://www.example.com) and it will extract the emails within some time. The max sub links it can go through is set to 100 as default. You can alter it if needed.
